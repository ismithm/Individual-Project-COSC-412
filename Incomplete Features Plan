Missing Features in Project 

Banking
- Try to look for a free plugin and accept foreign currency
- In order for it to be implmented research into depth which banks acccept foreign users and are willing to work on finding a way to ensure the payments are secure
- Alternatives are to see if banks on the users end of the account can be added rather than paypal since paypal does charge fees 

Captcha 
- Plugin for captcha requrires a high amount of money outside the budget the potential options are either creating my own version of a captcha or finding a way to neogitate with google
to allow me to have a student discount. I have tried to google the API for the following site but there are issues in terms of whether this can be added with the following Wordpress
Plugin known as WP Crowdfunding

Foreign Currency Exchange
- Many of the methods to display foreign currency within the site which can be either something based on the plugin itself but there are payments involved if there is a way to use strip

Being Able to Have User Login
- The user can login but the issue is they cannot make their own campaign right away unless I, the administrator can approve their campaign.There would have to be alternatives created to see if users can register and upload their own campaign
- The authenicated user is not able to choose the type of currency they want for their campaign and some banks do charge hefty charges
- In order to utilize the user login I would have to create a new category within the menu in order to give the user access or attempt to combine a new plugin known as the
Ultimate User Plugin.
-Letting User have a Capability of Creating their own campaign and choosing what currency they want to fund for which can be changed based on admin rights and by lookign at similar
crowdfunding plugins or even looking at premiums if it was affordable

Missing Pieces in Campaign 
- The Following image on the site is missing and I can't disable the video setting on the fundraising site you would have to attach a video no matter what the options 
I am going to use a different plugin since no matter what I do I can't even disable the video unless I can request the users to add a video or see if a private video can be added
